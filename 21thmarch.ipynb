    "    Ordinal encoding and label encoding are both techniques for converting categorical data into\n",

    "In ordinal encoding, each category is assigned a unique integer value based on its position or order\n",
    "in the sequence. For example, if the categories are \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high,\" they might be assigned \n",
    "values of 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Ordinal encoding assumes that the categories have an inherent order or hierarchy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, label encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category without any inherent order or hierarchy.\n",
    "For example, if the categories are \"red,\" \"green,\" and \"blue,\" they might be assigned values of 1, 2, and 3, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice between ordinal encoding and label encoding depends on the nature of the data and the specific problem being\n",

    ". For example, if the categories are \"low,\" \"medium,\" and \"high\" income levels, then ordinal encoding might be appropriate\n",

    "of fruit, then label encoding would be more appropriate.\n",

    "    Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique that combines the principles of ordinal encoding\n",
    "and mean encoding to encode categorical features. In this technique, each category is assigned \n",
    "a value based on its relationship with the target variable. The categories that are more strongly\n",
    "correlated with the target variable are assigned higher values, and the categories that are less \n",
    "strongly correlated with the target variable are assigned lower values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of Target Guided Ordinal Encoding involves the following steps:\n",
    "1.Calculate the mean of the target variable for each category in the categorical feature.\n",
    "2.Sort the categories based on their mean target value.\n",
    "3.Assign ordinal values to each category based on their order in the sorted list. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, lets say we have a dataset with a categorical feature \"City\" and a target variable \n",
    "\"Salary\". We want to encode the \"City\" feature using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding. The process\n",
    "would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    ".Calculate the mean salary for each city.\n",
    ".Sort the cities based on their mean salary.\n",
    ".Assign ordinal values to each city based on their order in the sorted list.\n",

    "Suppose the mean salaries for each city are as follows:\n",

    ".Los Angeles: $75,000\n",
    ".San Francisco: $90,000\n",
    ".Chicago: $65,000\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, we would assign ordinal values to each city as follows:\n",

    ".New York: 2\n",
    ".Los Angeles: 3\n",
    ".San Francisco: 4\n",
    ".Chicago: 1\n",

    "In this example, Target Guided Ordinal Encoding has assigned higher values to cities with \n",

    "Target Guided Ordinal Encoding can be useful in machine learning projects where there are \n",
    "categorical features that are strongly correlated with the target variable. By encoding \n",
    "these features based on their correlation with the target variable, we can potentially improve \n",
    "the performance of our machine learning models. However, it is important to be cautious when \n",

    "feature and the target variable is not stable across different datasets.    \n",
